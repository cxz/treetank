#Treetank - Secure Treebased Storage

Treetank stores data securely by applying different layers on the stored data. Flexible handling of flat as well as tree-based data is supported by a native encoding of the tree-structures ongoing with suitable paging supporting integrity and confidentiality to provide throughout security.

Secure in this context includes integrity-checks, encryption to guard the confidentiality with tree-aware key handling and adaptive versioning approaches providing accountability.
Furthermore, different backends are provided while a binding to different cloud-infrastructures is in progress.

##What components does Treetank consists of?

Treetank consists out of three main components:

* Interfaces enabling data mappings to be stored are located in the interfacemodules
* The core layer containing the page layer and security measures are located in the coremodules. The corelayer furthermore contains the binding to different backends.
* Student projects are located in the studentmodules. Note that student projects are mainly well-tested and reviewed but neither feature-complete nor maintained.

##What is Treetank ?

Treetank is: 

* a complete Java-based library entirely mavenized
* acting as base for various thesis and papers
* offering flexible interfaces for storing various data (ranging from blocks to REST-resources)
* for a university project well-document and tested
