#Treetank - Secure Treebased Storage

Treetank stores data securely by applying different layers on the stored data. Flexible handling of flat as well as tree-based data is supported by a native encoding of the tree-structures ongoing with suitable paging supporting integrity and confidentiality to provide throughout security.

Secure in this context includes integrity-checks, confidentiality with tree-aware key handling, versioning to provide accountability.
Furthermore, different backends are provided while a binding to different cloud-infrastructures is in progress.
