 * This interface describes database instances handled by treetank. A database
 * is a persistent place where all data is stored. The access to the data is
 * done with the help of {@link ISession}s.
 * 
 * Furthermore, databases can be created with the help of {@link org.access.conf.DatabaseConfiguration}s.
 * After creation, the settings
 * of a database cannot be changed.
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // Simple session with standards as defined in <code>EDatabaseSetting</code> and 
 * <code>ESessionSetting</code>. Creation takes place in open-process
 * final IDatabase database = Database.openDatabase(&quot;examplek&quot;);
 * final ISession session = database.getSession()
 * 
 * // Database with berkeley db and incremental revisioning.
 * final Properties dbProps = new Properties();
 * dbProps.setProperty(STORAGE_TYPE.name(),StorageType.Berkeley.name());
 * dbProps.setProperty(REVISION_TYPE.name(), ERevisioning.INCREMENTAL.name());
 * final DatabaseConfiguration dbConfig = new DatabaseConfiguration(&quot;example&quot;, dbProps);
 * Database.create(dbConfig);
 * final IDatabase database = Database.openDatabase(&quot;examplek&quot;);
 * final ISession session = database.getSession();
